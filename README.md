# Elansol-Task-React-Crud
This GitHub repository hosts a full-stack web application built using Node.js, MongoDB, React, and JSON Web Token (JWT) for authentication. The application provides functionality for user registration, login, and a dashboard where authenticated users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their data.
# Features:
1. User Authentication: Implements secure user authentication using JSON Web Token (JWT) to protect routes and ensure only authenticated users can access certain functionalities.

2. Registration Page: Allows users to create a new account by providing necessary details such as username, email, and password2.

3. Login Page: Provides a login interface for users to authenticate themselves using their registered credentials.

4. Dashboard Page: After successful authentication, users are directed to a dashboard where they can manage their data.

5. CRUD Operations: Enables users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete their data stored in the MongoDB database through intuitive interfaces.

6. Node.js Backend: Utilizes Node.js for the backend server, providing a robust and scalable foundation for handling requests, business logic, and database interactions.

7. MongoDB Database: Integrates MongoDB as the database to store user information and application data, ensuring data persistence and flexibility.

8. React Frontend: Implements the user interface using React, a p8.opular JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.

9. RESTful API: Adheres to RESTful principles for defining API endpoints, facilitating communication between the frontend and backend.

10.Secure Authentication: Implements best practices for secure authentication, including password hashing and JWT token validation.

11.Clean Codebase: Maintains a clean and well-structured codebase, following industry-standard coding conventions and practices.

12.Documentation: Provides comprehensive documentation to guide developers through setting up, running, and extending the application.

13.This project serves as a practical demonstration of building a full-stack web application with user authentication and CRUD operations using Node.js, MongoDB, React, and JWT. It can be used as a learning resource or as a starting point for developing similar applications.
